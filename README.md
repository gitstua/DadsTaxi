# DadsTaxi
A fictional taxi

## What is it?
Based on an idea from @lostdoco I created a site to show how busy he and I get driving around our kids

## How did you build it?
Using Azure it was super easy for me to get started. I just created an Azure App Service then added in some Azure Maps goodness using JavaScript.

I used GitHub to store source code and GitHub Actions to build and deploy
